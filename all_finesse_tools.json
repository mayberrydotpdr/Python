From the bottom of the hook to the tip is 4\". Designed by techs for techs. This tool is fast becoming one of our best sellers because of its versatility. It will reach those impossible dents like through stake pockets, near tops of bedsides and many other places that a straight shaft tool just can not reach. It is a fantastic, versatile tool that will pay for itself many times over. (Not just for under braces).   "

         "This revolutionary new tool cart is designed to set up easy, and to pack up easy, into a convenient carrying case. It's folded dimensions are 28 Â¼â inches by 18 inches by 4 Â¾â inches tall. The casters have an expanding rubber stem that slides into the aluminum tube on each corner. With the lock depressed, they are tightened in place by two or three turns clockwise. These heavy duty zinc plated, steel casters have polyurethane on aluminum wheels and are dual locking (i.e. both the swivel and the rotation of the wheels lock, with one smooth action).   The lid is secured on the carrying case by four wingnuts. To set up the Fold-N-Go simply remove the four Wing nuts and unfold the two main support legs. Then reattach the lid to the main support legs with the 4 Wing nuts that held it in place previously. The fold and go tool cart is stable on two legs from 28 to 35 inches tall,  for light duty use. If more height is necessary or if you intend to use a fully loaded tool cart we have included two additional support legs that install In just a few seconds. The additional support legs can be added after some tools have been loaded to the cart, or at any time. In other words you can unfold this thing and get to work as soon as you get there. If you see that you're going to need several tools you can then go ahead and add the additional legs lying in the bottom of the cart. The  accessory (or glue tray) mounting points are found at the end of the additional support legs. It is necessary to have them installed before you can install a Glue Tray (sold separately) .      Heavy duty 1/8 inch thick wall aluminum construction.    Packs up into an attractive carrying case.    Allows you to start pushing dents as soon as you get there!    It really is fast and easy to set up or tear down!    Tool box liner in the bottom of the cart Is a great place to set extra batteries.    With smooth rolling casters this cart can be pulled around the shop with one finger.    Extremely stable even at a great height.    Plenty of large holes and slots make it easy to get organized.   Production model that will always be in stock. ( IN STOCK NOW )  It is Rock Solid! Not rickety In the hinges, like some popular folding tool carts.   If this description left you wanting to know more, please check out our Google Slides Graphical Description(The most detailed description) or our video description below.    Don't forget to look at the Large Glue Tray, and extra height extension.( Large Glue Tray ). Also available in plastic, ( Large Plastic Glue Tray ).     "

The case folded up is 4 in thick x 17.5 in wide x 35 in long.  The Hood Stand open is 35 in x 35 in and adjusts up and down to accomodate any height of tech, standing or sitting position, from the tallest to the shortest tech pushing dents.  This Hood Stand will accomdate from the smallest Euro deck lid (with a central deck lid latch) to the largest domestic hood.    All of the product's pieces will fit inside its case that folds out to make the table top.  It also comes with a soft top cushion to protect your arms and elbows while pushing dents.  Compact enough to stow easily, to include the techs that fly.  This can also be purchased with the SUV/Mini van roof leverage bar .  Which also works on the rear of hoods while mounting them on the hood stand to elimanate the need for ratchet ropes and provides a fulcrum bar for leveraging on the hood.  (The bar installs with two bolts on the hood hinge mount.  Which makes the hood stand extremely sturdy.) The accessory bar sells for an additional $250.00 and doubles as a roof bar on SUV and Mini van roofs.   Compact enough to stow easily!

         "7\" long T handle glue puller. It has a groove cut around the tip where the glue tab inserts, with an O'ring so if the tab snaps loose it doesn't roll under the car or fly across the room. The O-ring also keeps the tool from scratching the vehicle if laid on it. The DManT allows you to pull pressure on large or small dents while working the crown to relieve the pressure on the dent. This tool was designed by a body man that is now a full time PDR tech. It is a fantastic tool to work large dents. The T handle has holes in it to hook it up to a rachet strap for hard glue pulling with both hands free to work the crowns or help the dent out by other methods. It is a large dent dream tool. Sold as a set with 18\" Slide Hammer for $161, see related products for more information on the 102 & 103 set. "

         " This door tool is a 24\" long 5/16\" diameter slow bend shaved 4\" long 82Â° bend flag, with a straight 6\" long reverse adjustable handle.  The difference between this tool and the regular door tools (with an adjustable handle) is that this tool features the adjustable handle gear reversed.  Reversing the gear transforms this tool into a brace tool that will not slip out of gear because the tech has to push down to make the handle change positions.   "

This tool was designed by Bill Hulett for pushing a lot of metal without damaging the paint. This is an excellent specialty tool for raising character ridges on hoods as well as large diameter soft dents. "

         " Our Fender lip tool, also known as the \"New Fender Tool\" has received alot of attention and positive feedback from the PDR community.  #248 Fender lip tool has a deep hook and tight radius, eagle talon tip for good contact around the fender's wheel well opening. Additionally it has a 10 degree bend, 11\" back from the tip making it posable to gain leverage off of the tire. Similar to our popular #143w Fender tool , but it's shallow 10 degree bend is better suited for the modern low profile deep dish wheels and tires. This design is also much easier to fit into a tool case. It's a great tool, useful for far more than just the fender lip. It also works nicely around headlight/taillight openings and body opening edges everywhere.  24\" long, 3/8 diameter rod Welded Handle Compact design Carefully crafted tip "

From the bottom of the hook to the tip is 4\". Designed by techs for techs. This tool is fast becoming one of our best sellers because of its versatility. It will reach those impossible dents like through stake pockets, near tops of bedsides and many other places that a straight shaft tool just can not reach. It is a fantastic, versatile tool that will pay for itself many times over. (Not just for under braces).   "

         " Our Fender lip tool, also known as the \"New Fender Tool\" has received alot of attention and positive feedback from the PDR community.  #248 Fender lip tool has a deep hook and tight radius, eagle talon tip for good contact around the fender's wheel well opening. Additionally it has a 10 degree bend, 11\" back from the tip making it posable to gain leverage off of the tire. Similar to our popular #143w Fender tool , but it's shallow 10 degree bend is better suited for the modern low profile deep dish wheels and tires. This design is also much easier to fit into a tool case. It's a great tool, useful for far more than just the fender lip. It also works nicely around headlight/taillight openings and body opening edges everywhere.  24\" long, 3/8 diameter rod Welded Handle Compact design Carefully crafted tip "

Additionally it has a 10 degree bend, 11\" back from the tip making it posable to gain leverage off of the tire. Similar to our popular #143w Fender tool , but it's shallow 10 degree bend is better suited for the modern low profile deep dish wheels and tires. This design is also much easier to fit into a tool case. It's a great tool, useful for far more than just the fender lip. It also works nicely around headlight/taillight openings and body opening edges everywhere.  24\" long, 3/8 diameter rod Welded Handle Compact design Carefully crafted tip "

      "description": [
         "This revolutionary new tool cart is designed to set up easy, and to pack up easy, into a convenient carrying case. It's folded dimensions are 28 Â¼â inches by 18 inches by 4 Â¾â inches tall. The casters have an expanding rubber stem that slides into the aluminum tube on each corner. With the lock depressed, they are tightened in place by two or three turns clockwise. These heavy duty zinc plated, steel casters have polyurethane on aluminum wheels and are dual locking (i.e. both the swivel and the rotation of the wheels lock, with one smooth action).   The lid is secured on the carrying case by four wingnuts. To set up the Fold-N-Go simply remove the four Wing nuts and unfold the two main support legs. Then reattach the lid to the main support legs with the 4 Wing nuts that held it in place previously. The fold and go tool cart is stable on two legs from 28 to 35 inches tall,  for light duty use. If more height is necessary or if you intend to use a fully loaded tool cart we have included two additional support legs that install In just a few seconds. The additional support legs can be added after some tools have been loaded to the cart, or at any time. In other words you can unfold this thing and get to work as soon as you get there. If you see that you're going to need several tools you can then go ahead and add the additional legs lying in the bottom of the cart. The  accessory (or glue tray) mounting points are found at the end of the additional support legs. It is necessary to have them installed before you can install a Glue Tray (sold separately) .      Heavy duty 1/8 inch thick wall aluminum construction.    Packs up into an attractive carrying case.    Allows you to start pushing dents as soon as you get there!    It really is fast and easy to set up or tear down!    Tool box liner in the bottom of the cart Is a great place to set extra batteries.    With smooth rolling casters this cart can be pulled around the shop with one finger.    Extremely stable even at a great height.    Plenty of large holes and slots make it easy to get organized.   Production model that will always be in stock. ( IN STOCK NOW )  It is Rock Solid! Not rickety In the hinges, like some popular folding tool carts.   If this description left you wanting to know more, please check out our Google Slides Graphical Description(The most detailed description) or our video description below.    Don't forget to look at the Large Glue Tray, and extra height extension.( Large Glue Tray ). Also available in plastic, ( Large Plastic Glue Tray ).     "

         "#270JH 19\" Highly Talon  The \"Highly Talon \" is highly useful but that's not where it got its name. While we were up at John Highly shop putting together the \"Tactical PDR Set\". John had a couple of tools that he wanted us to make. This is one of his custom tools, the other one has a part number of 271JH. The original Custom Tool that this was patterned after was well-worn I believe that you will find this model as useful as it has been to John over the years.   19 in long  3/8 diameter  "

The Hood Stand open is 35 in x 35 in and adjusts up and down to accomodate any height of tech, standing or sitting position, from the tallest to the shortest tech pushing dents.  This Hood Stand will accomdate from the smallest Euro deck lid (with a central deck lid latch) to the largest domestic hood.    All of the product's pieces will fit inside its case that folds out to make the table top.  It also comes with a soft top cushion to protect your arms and elbows while pushing dents.  Compact enough to stow easily, to include the techs that fly.  This can also be purchased with the SUV/Mini van roof leverage bar .  Which also works on the rear of hoods while mounting them on the hood stand to elimanate the need for ratchet ropes and provides a fulcrum bar for leveraging on the hood.  (The bar installs with two bolts on the hood hinge mount.  Which makes the hood stand extremely sturdy.) The accessory bar sells for an additional $250.00 and doubles as a roof bar on SUV and Mini van roofs.   Compact enough to stow easily!

         " Our Fender lip tool, also known as the \"New Fender Tool\" has received alot of attention and positive feedback from the PDR community.  #248 Fender lip tool has a deep hook and tight radius, eagle talon tip for good contact around the fender's wheel well opening. Additionally it has a 10 degree bend, 11\" back from the tip making it posable to gain leverage off of the tire. Similar to our popular #143w Fender tool , but it's shallow 10 degree bend is better suited for the modern low profile deep dish wheels and tires. This design is also much easier to fit into a tool case. It's a great tool, useful for far more than just the fender lip. It also works nicely around headlight/taillight openings and body opening edges everywhere.  24\" long, 3/8 diameter rod Welded Handle Compact design Carefully crafted tip "

From the bottom of the hook to the tip is 4\". Designed by techs for techs. This tool is fast becoming one of our best sellers because of its versatility. It will reach those impossible dents like through stake pockets, near tops of bedsides and many other places that a straight shaft tool just can not reach. It is a fantastic, versatile tool that will pay for itself many times over. (Not just for under braces).   "

These tools are large dent dream tools, a must have set for glue pulling .       #103  7\" long T handle glue puller. It has a groove cut around the tip where the glue tab inserts, with an O'ring so if the tab snaps loose it doesn't roll under the car or fly across the room. The O-ring also keeps the tool from scratching the vehicle if laid on it. The DManT allows you to pull pressure on large or small dents while working the crown to relieve the pressure on the dent. This tool was designed by a body man that is now a full time PDR tech. It is a fantastic tool to work large dents. The T handle has holes in it to hook it up to a rachet strap for hard glue pulling with both hands free to work the crowns or help the dent out by other methods. It is a large dent dream tool.       #102  Here is our slide hammer. It is made of stainless steel and is18 inches long. It weighs 2.3 pounds and it can be used like the DMan T glue puller.     "
